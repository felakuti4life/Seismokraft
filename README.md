Most recent stable version can be run at http://seismokraft.com 

NOTE: Seismokraft is still under development.

Requirements
------------
Seismokraft must be hosted on a server with PHP 5 or later installed.

Because Seismokraft uses the webAudio API, it can only be run on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox Nightly.

License
-------
Seismokraft is under a BSD license. The code can be distributed and repurposed freely.

Current State
--------------
Currently, Seismokraft is implementing a backtracking search algorithm to more reliably locate available time series data from recent events on the IRIS API. After this problem is solved, a stable version should be on its way.

Future Plans
-------------
Some of the Seismokraft platform may be repurposed into an open source data sonification framework for WebAudio in the future.
